## Description:

This repo was created to showcase a text editor using a webpack.

## Installation:

Run 'npm run install' from your root folder in your terminal, then run 'npm run start'.

## Usage:

To use this repo, you can dig through the code to see how webpacks work but I wouldn't recommend it because I ran out of time and couldn't finish this.
